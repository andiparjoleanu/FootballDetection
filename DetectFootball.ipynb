        "The computer needs to eliminate noise from an image to accurately detect an object. We resize the image for faster computation and apply a filter to each pixel to remove high-frequency noise. This filtering process is called convolution, which involves multiplying the value of each pixel by the corresponding value in the filter's matrix. We choose a Gaussian Filter because the Gaussian Curve emphasizes the value of the central pixel, creating a spherical effect in the filtered area. Thus, the circular shape of the ball is preserved, while smoothing the edges of sharp, straight objects (like grass or light glares). We choose the size of the filter as 11x11, large enough to smooth tiny shapes like grass and small enough to avoid blurring a ball (usually larger than 20 pixels wide)."

        "RGB images are hard to process in Computer Vision because of the mix between different colors and light. An HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) map for any pixel is more convenient because it defines the default color of the pixel (the hue), the intensity of the color (the saturation), and the brightness (the value). The hue is a circular 2D palette. In color theory, the hue is a circle, which is 360 degrees. An 8-bit memory contains numbers up to 255, so the computer divides the circle in half, making the hue go from 0 to 179. Our ball is red, so we create an HSV mask which compares the pixel's color with the values of the red tones. According to the HSV scheme, the red tones sit between 0 and 10 (orange-reds) and also between 165 to 179 (pink-reds)."
